# Codex CLI Adapter

Core setup — App registration, token minting, the credential helper, and `as-me` (Phases 1–3) — is harness-neutral and lives in the [agent-bot-identity SKILL](../../SKILL.md).
This reference is the Codex CLI implementation of the SKILL's Phase 4 routing contract.
Every mechanism claim below traces to a recorded probe or live-verification result against `codex-cli 0.143.0`; where the evidence says something is impossible or untested, this doc says so plainly.

## Status

Variant A verified (core routing contract) against `codex-cli 0.143.0` on 2026-07-07, with a documented `as-me` limitation; Variant B pending.

Checks 1–5, 7, and 8 of the verification list below all pass end-to-end: PATH takeover, static identity env, per-invocation `gh` minting, the credential-helper rewrite, sandbox minting, fail-closed token handling, and the installation access boundary all hold under live testing.
The one gap is `as-me` — see the `as-me` limitation section: under this Codex version's sandbox the human-authorship override cannot run, so collaborated authorship happens outside Codex.

Scope of the live verification, stated honestly: no branch was pushed and no `gh pr create` was run under Codex.
Check 4 proved the authenticated HTTPS-rewrite path with `git ls-remote` and check 5 made a local commit; the write path to GitHub (push, PR creation) rides the same token and credential helper but was not exercised end-to-end here.

Variant B (a user-level, automatic, per-command re-decision like Claude Code's) is **pending**, not shipped.
It would require a mechanism that re-decides bot-vs-personal before every command with the same fail-closed properties, and no `$CLAUDE_ENV_FILE` equivalent — a file whose contents are evaluated in each command's own shell and working directory — was found in Codex 0.143.0.
The profile mechanism Variant A uses is decided once per invocation, not per command, so it cannot back Variant B.

## Activation surface — named `bot` profile, per invocation

The activation surface is a named profile (`bot`) invoked explicitly on every run: `codex sandbox --profile bot ...` or `codex exec --profile bot ...` (both the top-level `--profile` and the subcommand-local `--profile` placements load the profile identically — probe-verified).

**Read this first — the fail direction is weaker than Claude Variant A.**
Because activation is a per-invocation flag, **forgetting `--profile bot` silently runs the personal identity** — commits attribute to the human, `gh` uses the personal login.
That is a weaker opt-in than Claude Code Variant A's per-repo `.claude/settings.local.json` file, which is present-or-absent per repo rather than remembered per command.
Treat `--profile bot` as mandatory on every Codex invocation in an enrolled repo; there is no file that makes it automatic.

Automatic, project-scoped activation (the Claude Variant A analog of a repo shipping its own config) is **pending — not available in this Codex version**.
A project-scoped `.codex/config.toml` at the repo root is **never loaded** by Codex 0.143.0: probed under `codex sandbox` and `codex exec`, and even with the directory explicitly marked `trusted` via a `-c projects."<path>".trust_level=trusted` override, the project config's `shell_environment_policy.set` value never took effect.
Directory trust state only gates interactive approval prompts; it does not toggle loading of any repo-local config file, and no such loading mechanism exists in this version.

The profile lives at `$CODEX_HOME/bot.config.toml` (default `~/.codex/bot.config.toml`), a **separate file** layered on top of the base `~/.codex/config.toml` by `--profile bot` — the base config is not edited.
`codex exec` in a non-interactive path defaults to `approval: never` and `sandbox: read-only` with no trust prompt, so automation is not blocked by a prompt; the gap is purely the missing per-repo file, not an approval wall.

## Static identity env

Codex applies static identity through the profile's `shell_environment_policy.set` block, which `--profile bot` reads directly (verified: PATH and every `GIT_*` var below took effect under `--profile bot`).
The block mirrors the Claude Variant A env — four identity vars, the `GIT_CONFIG_*` credential-helper reset plus bot helper, org-scoped `insteadOf`, and `commit.gpgsign false`.

Replace `<BOT_UID>` with the bot user ID from Phase 2, `acme` with your org, and `<you>` with your username (keep every path absolute).
These examples use the recommended flat `~/.config/acme-agent/bin/` install location; existing `~/.claude/bot-shims/` installs keep working because the scripts self-locate — just keep every path consistent.

The verified `bot` profile used the inline `set = { … }` table form (a TOML inline table is a single logical line):

```toml
[shell_environment_policy]
set = { PATH = "/Users/<you>/.config/acme-agent/bin:/opt/homebrew/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin", GIT_AUTHOR_NAME = "acme-agent[bot]", GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL = "<BOT_UID>+acme-agent[bot]@users.noreply.github.com", GIT_COMMITTER_NAME = "acme-agent[bot]", GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL = "<BOT_UID>+acme-agent[bot]@users.noreply.github.com", GIT_CONFIG_COUNT = "4", GIT_CONFIG_KEY_0 = "credential.helper", GIT_CONFIG_VALUE_0 = "", GIT_CONFIG_KEY_1 = "credential.helper", GIT_CONFIG_VALUE_1 = "!$HOME/.config/acme-agent/bin/git-credential-bot", GIT_CONFIG_KEY_2 = "url.https://github.com/acme/.insteadOf", GIT_CONFIG_VALUE_2 = "git@github.com:acme/", GIT_CONFIG_KEY_3 = "commit.gpgsign", GIT_CONFIG_VALUE_3 = "false" }
```

What each part does (identical in intent to the Claude Variant A env):

- `GIT_AUTHOR_*` / `GIT_COMMITTER_*` override global `user.*` so commits attribute to the bot.
- The empty `credential.helper` (`GIT_CONFIG_VALUE_0`) resets the inherited helper list; the next entry installs the bot helper as the only one.
- `insteadOf` rewrites org SSH remotes to HTTPS inside the profile only, so pushes use the bot token instead of the personal SSH key.
  The match is literal and case-sensitive — normalize each enrolled repo's remote to canonical lowercase, and add a second `insteadOf` pair (bumping `GIT_CONFIG_COUNT`) for any `ssh://git@github.com/acme/` form.
- `commit.gpgsign false` keeps bot commits unsigned so the personal GPG key never signs bot-authored work.

The `GIT_CONFIG_VALUE_1` helper value is `!$HOME/.config/acme-agent/bin/git-credential-bot`; `$HOME` there is expanded by git's shell when it runs the helper, not by Codex.
The PATH value, by contrast, must be a literal absolute path — see the next section.

## PATH

Codex's `shell_environment_policy.set.PATH` **REPLACES** PATH; it does not merge, and it performs no `$PATH` expansion (probe-verified — you cannot write `"$SHIMS:$PATH"` and expect the old PATH appended).
So the value must be a complete, literal, absolute PATH with the shim directory first.
The known-good composed value (shim dir first, then the core Homebrew/system dirs) is:

```
/Users/<you>/.config/acme-agent/bin:/opt/homebrew/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin
```

A truncated or invalid PATH does not degrade gracefully — it breaks command execution outright.
Probed with a garbage value, the sandbox could not resolve the command interpreter at all:

```
$ codex sandbox -c 'shell_environment_policy.set.PATH="nonexistent-garbage-path"' sh -c 'echo hi'
sandbox-exec: execvp() of 'sh' failed: No such file or directory
(exit 71)
```

So keep every core system directory in the value; the shim dir goes first only so its `gh` shadows the real `gh`.
Do not use `~` or `$HOME` in the PATH value — the OS uses PATH directly for `execvp` with no shell expansion; write the fully-resolved absolute path.

`uv` **must** be on the replacement PATH.
`bot-token` is a `uv run --script` shebang, invoked by the `gh` shim and — through git's `sh -c` — by `git-credential-bot`, so every mint dies without it.
A Homebrew `uv` is already covered by `/opt/homebrew/bin`; the standalone installer puts `uv` in `~/.local/bin`, which the minimal PATH above omits, and a missing `uv` breaks `gh` and every push.
Run `command -v uv` in a personal shell and make sure that directory is in the value.

Per-repo dev tooling may need the PATH extended.
A repo's own pre-commit hook runner (e.g. `prek`, installed via `uv tool install` under `~/.local/bin`) is not on the minimal PATH above; during verification `~/.local/bin` had to be appended for a repo whose `commit-msg`/pre-commit hooks required it (Check 5).
Extend the PATH value with such directories as needed — appended after the core dirs — but keep the shim directory first.

Verify the shim wins before doing any `gh` work: `command -v gh` inside the profile must resolve to the shim path, not `/opt/homebrew/bin/gh`.

## `gh` auth

`gh` auth routes through `scripts/codex/gh`, installed as `gh` first on the Codex-controlled PATH.
The shim mints a fresh installation token on **every invocation** (it calls the shared `bot-token`), exports it as `GH_TOKEN`, then `exec`s the real `gh`.
On mint failure it substitutes the non-empty sentinel `BOT-TOKEN-MINT-FAILED` so `gh` errors loudly with a 401 instead of treating an empty `GH_TOKEN` as unset and silently falling back to the personal stored credentials (verified in Check 8: a non-executable `bot-token` produced a clean `Bad credentials (HTTP 401)`, never the personal account).

Install it and set its one placeholder:

```bash
cp agent-bot-identity/scripts/codex/gh ~/.config/acme-agent/bin/gh
chmod +x ~/.config/acme-agent/bin/gh
# edit REAL_GH="REPLACE" → the absolute path to the real gh (e.g. /opt/homebrew/bin/gh)
```

Scope of the claim: this covers **well-behaved `gh` resolution through the Codex-controlled PATH** — a bare `gh ...` command finds the shim first and acts as the bot.
It does not cover anything that goes around the shim: an absolute path to the real `gh` (`/opt/homebrew/bin/gh`), a shell alias, or calling `bot-token` / the real `gh` directly all bypass it and reach the personal credentials (Check 10 confirmed the absolute-path bypass returns the personal account).

**This buys attribution, not containment.**
The adapter is a PATH-routing convention, not an OS- or sandbox-enforced restriction — the hard boundaries are the App's installation list (Check 7) and the server-side rulesets of the repos it touches (SKILL Phase 6).
Never present it as a sandbox.

## `as-me` limitation

Under `codex-cli 0.143.0`'s sandbox, `.git`-mutating commands succeed **only as a bare, literal `git ...`** invocation.
Any other shape — an env-prefix, a wrapper script (this skill's `as-me`), an inline `git -c alias.…=!… as-me …` form, or command substitution inside the arguments — is **denied** with `fatal: Unable to create '.../.git/index.lock': Operation not permitted`.
This was root-caused by bisection (Check 6 and the follow-up workaround probes): the denial is **not** identity-specific — even a semantically empty `env git commit ...` or an unrelated `FOO=bar git commit ...` fails, while ordinary non-`.git` file writes under the same `workspace-write` session succeed.
Codex grants `.git` internal writes to a command it recognizes as a bare `git` invocation and does not extend that grant through any wrapper.
`.git` writes only ever succeeded under `codex exec` (where the recognition layer runs); under `codex sandbox` even a bare `git commit` is denied, so `codex exec` is the surface for git-mutating work.

Consequence: **`as-me` cannot run through Codex here**, so the human-authorship escape does not work.

The only partial measure that survives the sandbox is a **literal** `--author` flag:

```
git commit --allow-empty --author="Firstname Lastname <you@example.com>" -m "..."
```

This succeeds (verified), and GitHub attributes **authorship** to the human — but the **committer remains the bot**, because `--author` overrides only the author field while the committer still comes from the `GIT_COMMITTER_*` env vars, which cannot be cleared without a wrapper (every wrapper form is denied).
A command-substituted author value (`--author="$(git config user.name) …"`) is also denied — the value must be a literal string.
So `--author` is not equivalent to `as-me`: the commit reads author=human, committer=bot, unsigned.

Therefore, collaborated authorship happens **outside Codex** — in a personal terminal, or through the Claude Code adapter where `as-me` works.
The recovery mirrors the skill's existing guidance: if the agent committed as the bot and the work was collaborated, amend from a personal terminal (`as-me git commit --amend --reset-author`).

## Sandbox profile

The profile ships the minimal sandbox settings needed for the `gh` mint to succeed both cold (no cached token) and warm (cache hit) in one profile:

```toml
sandbox_mode = "workspace-write"

[sandbox_workspace_write]
writable_roots = ["/Users/<you>/.cache/uv", "/Users/<you>/.cache/acme-agent"]
network_access = true
```

Write the roots as fully-resolved **absolute** paths, as shown — Codex may not expand `~` in `writable_roots`, and a `~`-prefixed root silently grants nothing.

What each is for, from the minting probes:

- `network_access = true` is required for the **cold mint** only — the GitHub API call to exchange the App JWT for an installation token.
  A negative control without it failed at DNS resolution (`httpx.ConnectError: nodename nor servname provided`), confirming the sandbox blocks network at the DNS layer.
  A cache hit needs no network, but the profile keeps it enabled because the invocation cannot know cold-vs-warm in advance.
- The `~/.cache/uv` writable root is required on **every** run, cold or warm — the `bot-token` script is a `uv run --script` shebang, and `uv` must write to its own cache (`sdists-v9/.git`) just to resolve the script's environment before the token-cache logic runs.
  Omitting it fails immediately: `failed to open file .../uv/sdists-v9/.git: Operation not permitted`.
- The `~/.cache/acme-agent` writable root is the single leaf directory `bot-token` writes its `token.json` cache into.
  It need not exist beforehand: a cold mint with the directory absent creates it and succeeds (verified).

**Grant these two roots and nothing else.**
Do **not** make the bot *config* directory (`~/.config/acme-agent`) writable: under the SKILL's flat-install recommendation it holds `key.pem` **and** every fail-closed script — `bot-token`, `git-credential-bot`, and this `gh` shim.
A `workspace-write` Codex session with that root could rewrite the App private key and the routing that is supposed to bind it.
Codex's sandbox is the one real boundary in this design; do not punch through it for a cache path.
Verified under the narrowed roots above: the cold and warm mints both succeed, `key.pem` stays readable so minting works, and writes to `~/.config/acme-agent` — including to `key.pem` itself — are denied (`Operation not permitted`).

**Recorded quirk — `--profile bot` does not apply the profile's top-level `sandbox_mode` by itself.**
`--profile bot` reliably applies `shell_environment_policy.set` (PATH and all identity vars), but under `codex sandbox` the profile's top-level `sandbox_mode = "workspace-write"` key is **not** honored on its own — the run stays effectively read-only and the `uv` cache write is denied.
The `[sandbox_workspace_write]` table (`writable_roots`, `network_access`) *does* apply from the profile; only the mode key needs forcing.
Ship the config that handles both surfaces:

- Under `codex sandbox`, force the mode explicitly: `codex sandbox --profile bot -c 'sandbox_mode="workspace-write"' <cmd>`.
- Under `codex exec`, the `-s` flag works directly: `codex exec --profile bot -s workspace-write --skip-git-repo-check <prompt>`.

(There is no `--full-auto` flag for `codex sandbox` — probed, it errors as an unexpected argument.)

## git auth

git auth is unchanged from the harness-neutral core: the org-scoped `insteadOf` SSH→HTTPS rewrite plus the host-gated `git-credential-bot` credential helper, both installed through the `GIT_CONFIG_*` env in the identity block above.
See [SKILL.md Phase 3](../../SKILL.md) for the credential helper.
Verified in Check 4: `GIT_SSH_COMMAND=/usr/bin/false git ls-remote origin` succeeds via HTTPS even with SSH disabled, proving the rewrite-plus-token path is in use and no SSH path is touched.

## Verification

Run these together with the SKILL's Phase 5 checks, from a fresh Codex invocation with `--profile bot`.
Skip the SKILL's `GH_TOKEN`-prefix and `as-me` bullets; checks 2 and 6 below replace them.
(A session-level `GH_TOKEN` is an audit smell here, not a pass: the shim exports it per invocation.)
Sandboxed checks use `codex sandbox --profile bot -c 'sandbox_mode="workspace-write"' sh -c '<cmd>'`; the commit checks use `codex exec --profile bot -s workspace-write --skip-git-repo-check '<prompt>'`.
Ten checks were run live; each is one line with its expected result.

1. `command -v gh` → the shim path (`~/.config/acme-agent/bin/gh`), proving the shim wins PATH. (PASS)
2. `gh api installation/repositories --jq .total_count` → the count of enrolled repos, proving `gh` acts as the bot. (PASS)
3. `git config --show-scope credential.helper` → bot helper at `command` scope, proving env-scoped with no file changed. (PASS)
4. `GIT_SSH_COMMAND=/usr/bin/false git ls-remote origin` → succeeds via the HTTPS rewrite + bot token, with SSH disabled. (PASS)
5. Real `codex exec` empty commit on a scratch branch → author and committer are the bot, `%G?` is `N` (unsigned), matching `commit.gpgsign=false`. (PASS)
6. `as-me git commit` → **expected FAIL** — this is the documented `as-me` limitation, not a setup error; Codex's sandbox denies `.git` writes for any wrapped/non-bare `git` invocation.
7. Negative boundary: `git ls-remote https://github.com/acme/<private-non-enrolled-repo>.git` → fails (`Repository not found`), proving the installation boundary. (PASS) — the probe repo must be **private and non-enrolled**; a public repo is readable unauthenticated and proves nothing.
8. Fail-closed: make `bot-token` non-executable → `gh` returns a loud `Bad credentials (HTTP 401)`, never a silent fall-through to the personal account; restore the exec bit afterward. (PASS)
9. Untrusted fresh clone (a directory Codex has never trusted) → behaves identically to the enrolled clone; `codex sandbox` never gates on directory trust. **Recorded behavior, not a pass/fail gate.**
10. Bypass smell: `/opt/homebrew/bin/gh api user --jq .login` (real `gh` by absolute path) → returns the **personal** account, confirming routing-not-enforcement. **Recorded behavior, not a pass/fail gate.**

Checks 1–5, 7, and 8 are the pass/fail gate and all pass; Check 6's failure is the documented limitation; Checks 9 and 10 are recorded behaviors, not gates.

Audit smells — any of these means the adapter is mis-wired:

- A stale static `GH_TOKEN` anywhere in Codex config (base `config.toml`, the `bot` profile, or a `-c` override): the token expires hourly and a static one silently rots into `gh` failures or, worse, masks the per-invocation mint.
  `GH_TOKEN` must come only from the `gh` shim.
- A `gh` alias or an absolute-path `gh` invocation (`alias gh=/opt/homebrew/bin/gh`, `/opt/homebrew/bin/gh …`) anywhere — shell config, dotfile, runbook, or agent workflow: each is a shim bypass that reaches the personal credentials (Check 10).
  Flag the alias even in an interactive-only file: it defeats the shim wherever it fires, and its presence signals `gh` routing outside the Codex-controlled PATH.
- Silent mint failure: the shim must fail closed with the non-empty `BOT-TOKEN-MINT-FAILED` sentinel so `gh` errors loudly (`Bad credentials (HTTP 401)`, Check 8) — an empty `GH_TOKEN` is treated as unset and falls back to the personal login.
  A setup with no visible mint-failure mode — or a runbook claiming minting "just works" without the sandbox prerequisites (`network_access = true` for the cold mint; `writable_roots` covering the `uv` and token caches) — is a smell.
- PATH shims installed via shell dotfiles (`.zshrc`, `.zprofile`) instead of the profile's `shell_environment_policy.set.PATH`: dotfile PATH order is not the Codex-controlled routing surface and leaks into personal shells.
