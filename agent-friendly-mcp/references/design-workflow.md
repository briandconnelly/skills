# MCP Server Design Workflow

Use this workflow when designing a new MCP server or redesigning an existing one. The output is a server whose tools, resources, and prompts pass `contract-checklist.md` end to end — that is, a contract an agent can plan against from the schema and structured responses alone, never undocumented prose outside the schema.

The steps are deliberately re-entrant: a later step often surfaces a flaw in an earlier decision (a granularity choice that breaks the schema, a discovery design that breaks under eval, an error taxonomy that exposes a missing primitive).
Re-entering Step N from Step N+3 is normal — treat earlier outputs as drafts until the eval at Step 8 holds.
The checkpoint links at each step point at the relevant `contract-checklist.md` sections; consult them as you work, not only at the end.

## Step 1: Enumerate user/agent tasks

List the real tasks an agent should be able to complete with this server.

- Write tasks, not endpoints. "Send a message to a Slack channel" is a task; `POST /chat.postMessage` is not.
- Pull tasks from real workflows — what a user or agent already does end-to-end without this server.
- Group near-duplicates; collapse 60 endpoint variations into the 6–10 tasks they actually serve.
- Note prerequisites per task (auth scope, workspace/project context, prior calls, implicit state, handles, cursors, jobs, or sessions that affect behavior) — these surface again in Step 5.
- Note optional MCP capabilities each task benefits from or requires: roots, completions, resource subscriptions, elicitation, list-change notifications, and tasks.
  Record the weaker-client fallback at the same time.

Output: a written task list, each task expressed as a verb phrase with the user/agent goal.
Checkpoint: §1, §3 granularity rule.

## Step 2: Choose the right primitive per task

For each task, pick tool, resource, or prompt scaffold.

- State-changing or operational? Tool. Annotate with `destructiveHint` / `idempotentHint` honestly.
- Read-only and browseable, with stable URIs the agent will quote back? Resource.
- Multi-step orchestration scaffolding the agent invokes by name? Prompt — but never load-bearing for correctness.
- A "write resource" is a tool. A "prompt that defines argument shapes" is a tool schema in disguise; reclassify it.

Output: per-task primitive assignment (tool / resource / prompt) with one-line justification each.
Checkpoint: §3, §4, §5.

## Step 3: Decide tool granularity

For each tool, choose task-completing vs composable primitive, and record the reason.

- Default to task-completing. Hide internal step granularity unless the steps are themselves separately useful tasks.
- Split into composable primitives only when a named exception applies or an eval (Step 8) shows the split helps a code-execution client — not on speculation.
- Named split exceptions: intermediate state inspection, branching on intermediate results, streaming large results, step reuse across workflows, and human-approval boundaries.
- Endpoint-shaped tools are an anti-pattern: collapse endpoint chains into the task they serve.
- If two tools' descriptions need long prose to disambiguate, the granularity is wrong.

Output: per-tool granularity decision with explicit reasoning (task-completing or composable, and why).
Checkpoint: §3 granularity rule.

## Step 4: Write input schemas

Treat the schema as the authoritative contract. Write it before behavior.

- Required vs optional discipline: required parameters are necessary; optional ones declare their omission semantics in the schema description, with `default` only where the server actually applies that value (§3).
- Strict types: enums for fixed value sets; formats (`date-time`, `uri`, `email`); `integer` vs `number` chosen deliberately.
- Schema dialect: declare it where supported, and close object schemas with `additionalProperties: false` unless extension fields are intentional.
- Outputs: Publish an `outputSchema` and return `structuredContent` when targeting MCP versions that support them.
  Keep parser-compatible JSON in `content` as the fallback for older or weaker clients.
- Rich results: for large or binary outputs, plan `resource_link` or embedded `resource` content plus a concise `structuredContent` summary instead of inlining bulk data.
- Disambiguating names: `user_id` not `user`, `started_after` not `since`, `channel_id` not `channel`.
- Descriptions cover when to use, edge cases, and an example invocation.

Output: complete tool input schemas, resource URI patterns, and prompt argument schemas — including descriptions and examples.
Checkpoint: §3, §4. See `examples.md` §1 for a worked tool schema and §5 for a prompt scaffold.

## Step 5: Design the discovery surface

Decide how an agent finds the right primitive at the lowest cost its clients allow (§2 defines the client-dependence rules).

- Write the server capability summary: what it does, what it does NOT do, and any prerequisites that affect whether or how an agent should use it.
- Expose the summary through a resource, discovery tool, or instructions field, whichever the client honors.
  Treat `instructions` as supplemental because some clients do not surface it to the model.
- Make compact definitions your baseline (§2), then, if you need progressive disclosure, pick a mechanism by cost axis: host-managed context disclosure, server-managed catalog disclosure, or client-independent surface reduction — only the last helps a client that preloads and never lazy-loads.
- Make discovery selective, but through a discovery tool, resource catalog, or authorization-scoped catalog — native `tools/list` takes only a pagination cursor and has no filter parameters. A flat list of 80 tools is undiscoverable.
- Index resources; do not inline bodies. Catalog entries carry triage metadata only.
- Publish `resources/templates/list` for URI-shaped resources that cannot or should not be fully enumerated.
- Implement `completion/complete` for prompt arguments and resource-template variables with dynamic value sets when `server.capabilities.completions` is negotiated.
  Document that completion does not cover arbitrary tool arguments.
- For workspace-scoped servers, request `roots/list` from clients that negotiate roots and declare how root changes are handled.
- If resource discoverability matters, provide a tool fallback for clients that do not expose resources well.

Output: server capability summary, discovery primitives implemented, resource catalog shape.
Checkpoint: §1, §2, §4. See `examples.md` §7 for a server capability summary and §8 for a `search_tools` response.

## Step 6: Design failure recovery

Design the error surface as deliberately as the success surface.

- Define stable, symbolic error codes (`not_found`, `rate_limited`, `invalid_field`) and document per-tool which codes can occur.
- Field-level validation feedback: which field, why invalid, allowed values; include the offending value when safe.
- Retryability and rate-limit signals: `retry_after_ms`, `temporary`, `rate_limit_remaining` where applicable.
- Tool semantic errors return as tool result errors with `isError: true`.
- Resource failures return JSON-RPC errors with structured `error.data` repair fields.
- Repair hints reference real callable surfaces — tool names, parameter names, valid enum values — not free-form prose.
- Capability failures name the missing negotiated capability and the fallback path (`capability_not_negotiated`, `required_capability`, `fallback`).
- If the server can use elicitation for missing input or sensitive external flows, define both the elicitation path and the non-elicitation fallback error.
- Draft a worked JSON payload for each top failure mode — not just a field inventory. Concrete payloads expose contradictions a field list hides.

Output: error taxonomy with example payloads for the top failure modes per tool, including correlation context (`request_id`, offending parameter).
Checkpoint: §6. See `examples.md` §6 for an actionable error payload.

## Step 7: Design long-running behavior

For each operation that may outlive a normal request/response turn, decide how the agent monitors and recovers it.

- Choose blocking `tools/call`, progress notifications, or task-augmented requests.
- Declare expected duration, timeout behavior, and whether partial progress is observable.
- Support `progressToken` and recover through native task operations where applicable — poll `tasks/get` (respect `pollInterval`), fetch with `tasks/result`, cancel with `tasks/cancel` — using the spec's task fields and statuses (`working`, `input_required`, `completed`, `failed`, `cancelled`).
- For `input_required`, design around the native path — the requestor preemptively calls `tasks/result` and holds it open; the pending input request arrives as a separate receiver-to-requestor request while the call is pending, and the held call returns the terminal result once input is supplied — and say whether the input mechanism is elicitation, URL-mode elicitation, or a domain-specific status/repair tool (§7).
- Enable tasks at both levels: declare the server `server.capabilities.tasks.requests.tools.call` and the tool's `execution.taskSupport` (`optional`, `required`, or `forbidden`).
  Tasks are experimental, so add a domain-specific status/cancel fallback only as a labeled stand-in for clients without task support.

Output: long-running behavior contract for each affected tool, including progress, cancellation, retrieval, and terminal-state semantics.
Checkpoint: §7.

## Step 8: Build evaluations grounded in real tasks

Build an eval suite from the Step 1 task list before iterating further.

- Use real workflows from Step 1 as the eval tasks; synthetic prompts hide discovery and selection failures.
- Measure first-call correctness: did the agent pick and call the right primitive on the first attempt?
- Measure first-repair correctness: given a structured error, did the agent's next call succeed?
- Measure token consumption and tool-call count per completed task — both are first-class quality signals.
- Include fixture types for cold-start/tool discovery, wrong-tool selection, invalid-argument, auth-failure, pagination, upgrade/version-change, and long-running progress plus cancel/recover.

A worked fixture for one task makes the metrics runnable rather than aspirational. Each fixture pairs a prompt with an assertion the harness can check against the transcript:

```json
{
  "task": "announce that api@v2.4.1 shipped to the #deploys channel",
  "expect_first_call": {"tool": "slack_send_message", "args_match": {"text": {"contains": "v2.4.1"}}},
  "metrics": {"max_tool_calls": 2, "max_tokens": 4000},
  "fixtures": [
    {
      "type": "cold_start",
      "given": "fresh connection, no prior discovery",
      "assert": "parameterized by host mode: on a preloading host, the serialized definitions the host injects stay within the token budget (the agent cannot avoid the load); on a lazy-loading host, the agent reads the capability summary or search_tools before loading full definitions"
    },
    {
      "type": "first_repair",
      "given": "first call passes channel_id='deploys' (a name, not a C… id)",
      "inject_error": {"code": "channel_not_found", "repair": {"tool": "slack_lookup_channel"}},
      "assert": "next call is slack_lookup_channel(name='deploys'), then slack_send_message with the resolved id — repair succeeds in one hop"
    },
    {
      "type": "discovery_cost",
      "assert": "tokens spent before the first useful call stay under the max_tokens budget; record the count, do not estimate"
    }
  ]
}
```

Score each run for first-call correctness (did `expect_first_call` match?), first-repair correctness (did the injected error resolve in one hop?), and the two budgets. A fixture that no current transcript can satisfy is a finding against the schema, not a flaky test.

Output: at least one eval task suite covering the high-value tasks from Step 1, with metrics for first-call correctness, first-repair correctness, token consumption, and tool-call count.
Checkpoint: §2, §3, §6, §7, §8, §9 — the eval should exercise discovery, tool selection, error repair, long-running behavior, token consumption, and upgrade behavior.

## Step 9: Iterate against the eval, including transcript review

Run the eval with an agent and read the transcripts; do not trust aggregate scores alone.

- Look for contradictions between description prose and schema; the schema wins, so fix the prose or the schema.
- Look for ambiguity in tool selection — two tools the agent confuses, or descriptions that overlap.
- Look for ineffective discovery: agents loading every definition, agents missing a tool that exists, agents picking the wrong namespace.
- Each iteration should produce a measurable improvement in first-call correctness, first-repair correctness, or token consumption — if it doesn't, the change wasn't grounded.

Output: revised schemas, descriptions, and discovery surface, with eval-measured improvement against the prior baseline.
Checkpoint: §1–§9 — walk the full checklist; iteration is the moment to catch contradictions any earlier checkpoint missed.
