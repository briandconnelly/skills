description: Use when designing, building, auditing, or reviewing an MCP server that AI agents will invoke directly. Symptoms include agents picking the wrong tool from many candidates, burning tokens loading hundreds of tool definitions upfront, repeated invalid tool calls due to ambiguous schemas, tools that mirror an underlying API endpoint-by-endpoint instead of completing tasks, missing or unclear resource browsing, prompts that duplicate tool contracts, token-heavy responses that should be paginated or filtered, brittle integrations that break across server versions, long-running operations with no progress, cancellation, or recoverable task status. Also use when defining or hardening tool, resource, or prompt schemas.

# Agent-Friendly MCP

Use this skill to make MCP servers easy for agents to discover, invoke correctly, recover from, and use at low token cost without sacrificing correctness.

## Spec Baseline

This skill is written against the **MCP 2026-07-28** specification (final, released 2026-07-28); the field names, capability paths, method set, and task lifecycle it uses follow that revision, including the `io.modelcontextprotocol/tasks` extension (SEP-2663).
Status caveat: the 2026-07-28 changelog calls tasks an official extension while the ext-tasks specification repository still labels itself experimental — treat the task contract as extension-versioned and re-verify it against the extension spec when it cuts a release.
The protocol core is stateless: there is no `initialize` handshake or session id — every request carries `io.modelcontextprotocol/protocolVersion` and `io.modelcontextprotocol/clientCapabilities` in `_meta` (both required), and servers advertise their own capabilities via the mandatory `server/discover` method.
Server-initiated requests are gone: elicitation, sampling, and roots requests ride Multi Round-Trip Requests (`resultType: "input_required"` with `inputRequests`, answered by retrying with `inputResponses`), and subscription notifications — list-changed, resource-updated, and task notifications — ride an opt-in `subscriptions/listen` stream, while request-scoped notifications (`notifications/progress`, `notifications/message`) stay on the originating request's response stream.
Every result carries a required `resultType`, and `server/discover`, list, and read results carry the native cache hints `ttlMs` and `cacheScope` on their `resultType: "complete"` results — MRTR interim results are never cacheable.
Roots, sampling, logging, the HTTP+SSE transport, and Dynamic Client Registration are deprecated on a twelve-month minimum window; design new servers without them.
The extensions framework is formal but demanding: an extension needs a reverse-DNS identifier, its own maintained specification, and negotiation by both peers (declared in `clientCapabilities.extensions` and `server/discover`), so a namespaced `_meta` key remains a private convention until someone does that work.
This section is the single home for revision-level facts: which revision is baseline, its release status, the tasks-extension caveat, and what is deprecated or removed.
Checklist rules and [native-wire-shapes.md](references/native-wire-shapes.md) necessarily restate the mechanics they govern, including a governed surface's deprecation status; for the revision-level frame they cite this section rather than restating it.
For clients that still speak **2025-11-25**, the binding rules here still govern what you build; the old revision's wire differences and version-bound failure modes are cataloged in the informative [mcp-2025-11-25-compat.md](references/mcp-2025-11-25-compat.md), and `decisions/001-mcp-2026-07-28-rebase.md` records the rebase decision, verified fact sheet, and impact matrix.

## Where The Recurring Concerns Live

A routing table, not a summary.
Each row names a concern this skill keeps returning to and the rules that govern it; the rules themselves are stated only in [contract-checklist.md](references/contract-checklist.md).
Read the cited ids — a row names the concern but does not define the rule, so a row is never a substitute for it.

| Concern | Governing rules |
| --- | --- |
| What carries the contract, and what is only advisory | `[5.scaffolding-only]`, `[5.ap-contract-container]`, `[2.instructions-advisory]` |
| Capability negotiation before optional features | `[1.negotiated-caps]` |
| Tool granularity: tasks vs endpoints | `[3.task-completing]`, `[3.hide-steps]`, `[3.ap-endpoint-wrapping]` |
| Side effects, idempotency, and rate limits | `[3.declare-effects]`, `[3.honest-annotations]`, `[3.annotation-defaults]` |
| Prerequisites and implicit state an agent can act on | `[1.implicit-state]`, `[2.summary]` |
| Structured vs rendered output | `[3.structured-default]`, `[3.output-schema]` |
| Designing for the least-capable realistic client | `[2.compact-baseline]`, `[2.progressive-disclosure]`, `[2.client-variance]` |
| Failure paths as contract | `[3.failure-contract]`, `[6.symbolic-codes]`, `[6.repair-object]` |

Cold-start first-call and first-repair success are the outcome measures this skill is tuned against: [design-workflow.md](references/design-workflow.md) Step 8 builds the measurement and Step 9 owns the regression gate.

## Native Fields vs Convention Extensions

This skill is deliberately opinionated: native MCP fields alone are often insufficient for agent-friendliness, so well-designed servers add convention extensions such as structured `errors`, `repair` hints, prompt prerequisites, detail toggles, and — where target clients cache or pin the surface (`[9.fingerprint]`) — a capability `fingerprint`.
Keep the conventions whose applicability rules hold — but never let them masquerade as protocol.
The native-vs-convention rule is homed in this section; [contract-checklist.md](references/contract-checklist.md), [native-wire-shapes.md](references/native-wire-shapes.md), and [examples.md](references/examples.md) cite it here rather than restating it.

- **Preserve native MCP field names and casing exactly; prefer `snake_case` for house/domain fields.**
  A field's provenance is determined by the MCP type that contains it, **not** by its casing — native `_meta` carries an underscore, `name`/`code`/`repair` are lowercase on both sides, and a convention object may hold a `mimeType`-style name.
  So casing is a preference for house fields, never a test for whether a field is protocol.
  Tool: `name`, `title`, `description`, `icons`, `inputSchema`, `outputSchema`, `annotations`, `_meta`.
  Resource: `uri`, `name`, `title`, `description`, `mimeType`, `size`, `icons`, `annotations`, `_meta`.
  Resource template: `uriTemplate`, `name`, `title`, `description`, `mimeType`, `icons`, `annotations`, `_meta`.
  Prompt: `name`, `title`, `description`, `icons`, `arguments`, `_meta`.
  Implementation: `name`, `title`, `version`, `description`, `icons`, `websiteUrl`.
- Put convention metadata under a namespaced `_meta` key (e.g., `com.example/chunks`) — the spec-sanctioned extension point — so it cannot collide with future MCP fields.
- Label every convention extension as such where it appears, so a reader can tell protocol from house style.
- The primary example blocks in this skill are wire-valid: convention metadata rides under a namespaced `_meta` key, never as a top-level field on a native record.
  See `examples.md` ex§1/ex§4/ex§5 for the worked `_meta` pattern; the few deliberately abbreviated blocks (e.g. ex§10) carry an explicit non-wire label.
- For the exact native request/response envelopes, field names, and casing of the methods most often confused with house conventions — per-request `_meta`, list pagination and cache hints, completion, the `tools/call` result, MRTR, subscriptions, HTTP routing headers, and the tasks-extension lifecycle — see [native-wire-shapes.md](references/native-wire-shapes.md).

## When To Use

- Designing a new MCP server that agents (Claude Code, Codex, custom agents) will invoke.
- Defining or hardening tool, resource, or prompt schemas for an existing server.
- Auditing an existing MCP server for agent-friendliness.
- Diagnosing concrete agent failures: wrong-tool selection from many candidates, repeated invalid tool calls, token waste from upfront definition loading, endpoint-mirroring tools that force long chains, broken cross-server upgrades.
- Designing long-running work: progress notifications, cancellation, tasks via the negotiated extension, and long-running operation patterns (see [contract-checklist.md](references/contract-checklist.md) §7 and [examples.md](references/examples.md) ex§11).

## When Not To Use

- General code review of MCP server internals that does not face agents — use your normal code-review workflow.
- Library or SDK design that is not exposed via MCP — this skill is MCP-specific.
- Trivial schema additions to an already agent-friendly server; just follow the existing contract.
- Out of scope: sampling and logging (both deprecated in 2026-07-28), server-operator dashboards, packaging/deployment, and skills-over-MCP (now a named extension in the formal extensions framework — revisit if it enters this skill's scope).
  Elicitation is in scope only as an agent-facing contract boundary; the binding rules live in [contract-checklist.md](references/contract-checklist.md) §1 (declare the dependency on the client's `elicitation` modes) and §6 (elicitation use and the non-elicitation fallback).
  Do not use this skill for designing full user-experience flows.

## Vocabulary

Shared terms — discovery surface, repair signal, state handle, capability fingerprint, negotiated capability, task-returning tool, and the rest — are defined in [vocabulary.md](references/vocabulary.md); consult it when a term in the checklist or workflows is unfamiliar.

## Checklist Map

The normative standard lives in [contract-checklist.md](references/contract-checklist.md), with two named exceptions homed in this file: the Spec Baseline facts and the native-vs-convention rule.
There are two routes into the standard, and every design or review declares which one it took.

- **Full walk** — read the checklist top to bottom.
  Required for a new server, a new primitive, a change to the auth model or the error taxonomy, a change of protocol-revision target, and any audit that reports coverage across §1–§9.
- **Focused route** — for a change scoped to a known surface, such as one tool's input schema or one error payload.
  1. Name the surface and the sections it touches.
  2. Read `[1.spec-revision]` and the native-vs-convention rule below whatever the surface; they govern how every other rule is read.
  3. Read the named sections in full — sections, not single bullets, so a rule is never read without its neighbours.
  4. Close over citations: for every rule you read, read the rule ids it cites, and repeat until nothing new is pulled in.
     Those citations are the dependency edges, and following them is what stops a focused read from applying a rule without the rules it depends on.
  5. Report the sections you did not read as `not-checked` with the reason, per [review-workflow.md](references/review-workflow.md) — a focused route is never reported as full coverage.
  Escalate to the full walk when step 4 pulls in more than two sections beyond those you named, or when the change turns out to add a primitive.

The closure in step 4 converges rather than expanding to the whole standard: measured against the current checklist, a single-rule seed closes at 1–3 rules, and a whole-section seed at 19–27% of the 12,211 words of rule text.
What is *not* measured is the focused route's effect on review quality — no scenario in `tests/scenarios.md` yet compares the two routes.
Until one does, prefer the full walk wherever its cost is acceptable, and treat the focused route as a documented reduction whose risk is unquantified.
This index orients and routes — its one-line summaries aid navigation and never define or override a rule.
State-handle discipline and long-running-operation contracts are normative in §1/§8 and §7 respectively; consult them there rather than a second copy here.
Notation: bare `§N` always means a contract-checklist section; `ex§N` means section N of [examples.md](references/examples.md).
A single rule is cited by its stable id, `` `[section.slug]` `` — `[3.naming]`, `[6.repair-object]` — which resolves to exactly one bullet in contract-checklist.md and survives rewording of that bullet.
Prefer a rule id over a section reference when you mean one specific rule; `tests/check_rule_ids.py` fails the build if a cited id does not resolve.

| § | Section | Section gist | Worked examples |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| §1 | Server-Level | Identity, transport (including required HTTP routing headers), auth modes, agent-actionable prerequisites, per-request capability declaration, and workspace scope — learnable in one read. State handles are declared here: opaque IDs, lifetime, expiry, auth on every use. | ex§7, ex§8a |
| §2 | Discovery | A capability summary plus compact definitions as the universal baseline; progressive disclosure is a client-dependent optimization — pick a mechanism by cost axis (host-managed context, server-managed catalog, or client-independent surface reduction). | ex§7, ex§8 |
| §3 | Tools | Task-completing tools over endpoint mirrors; strict closed schemas; honest annotations; failure paths are contract, not prose. | ex§1, ex§2, ex§2a, ex§10, ex§12, ex§13 |
| §4 | Resources | Stable hierarchical URIs; index before body; stable chunk ids; templates + completion; subscriptions for mutable resources. | ex§3, ex§4, ex§5a, ex§5b |
| §5 | Prompts | Advisory orchestration scaffolding only — reference tools by name, never redefine their contract. | ex§5 |
| §6 | Failure Recovery | Stable symbolic codes, field-level feedback, explicit retryability, repair hints naming real callable surfaces. | ex§6 |
| §7 | Long-Running Operations | Choose blocking / progress / task-augmented deliberately; declare duration and timeout; recover via the native task lifecycle with a labeled fallback. | ex§11 |
| §8 | Token Efficiency | Concise default with a `detail` toggle; native list methods paginate with `nextCursor` (omission = done) and carry honest `ttlMs`/`cacheScope`, while a tool's own result payload may use a documented `has_more` convention; explicit truncation with a repair hint; identifiers chosen by role. | ex§2 |
| §9 | Versioning | Publish a capability fingerprint where target clients cache or pin the surface; deterministic list ordering; native list-changed notifications; discoverable deprecation. | ex§9, ex§9a |

## Workflow

1. Classify the task: new MCP server or redesign vs review of an existing one.
2. For new design or redesign, follow [design-workflow.md](references/design-workflow.md).
3. For an audit, follow [review-workflow.md](references/review-workflow.md); severity scale and report format live there.
4. Use [contract-checklist.md](references/contract-checklist.md) as the detailed standard for both workflows.
5. Use [mcp-vs-cli.md](references/mcp-vs-cli.md) if deciding which surface to expose; use [examples.md](references/examples.md) for concrete schema, response, error, and discovery shapes.
6. When writing or auditing prose surfaces — server `instructions`, the capability summary, tool and resource descriptions — apply the rules-then-context discipline in [contract-checklist.md](references/contract-checklist.md) §2/§3/§4; if a separating-context-from-constraints skill is available in your environment, use it as the audit lens for those surfaces.
7. Once the contract is designed, implement it with an MCP SDK — e.g. FastMCP for Python or the official TypeScript SDK.
   This skill defines the agent-facing wire contract, not the framework; if a FastMCP (or equivalent SDK) skill is available in your environment, use it for implementation specifics.

## Done Criteria

Before declaring done, walk [contract-checklist.md](references/contract-checklist.md) against your output.

- **Design tasks**: every checklist section must have an answer in the schema set or be explicitly marked not-applicable with a one-line justification.
- **Review tasks**: every checklist section is either covered by a finding, marked `OK` with brief evidence, or noted `not-checked` with reason.
  Use the severity scale and report format defined in [review-workflow.md](references/review-workflow.md).
