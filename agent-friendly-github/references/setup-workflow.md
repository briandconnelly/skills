# Setup Workflow

Use this workflow to configure a new repository for agent work, or to harden an existing one.
The workflow walks every item in [config-checklist.md](config-checklist.md) and emits concrete artifacts — ruleset JSON, CODEOWNERS files, workflow permission blocks, and label definitions — that live in [examples.md](examples.md).
Steps are ordered by blast-radius: you close the dangerous gaps first and add the productivity surface only after the guardrails are in place.

Note: if you use the GitHub MCP server to carry out these steps, it is subject to the same identity and permission constraints as any other agent surface — the ruleset, CODEOWNERS ownership, and required checks apply regardless of which API surface the agent uses.

## Ordering Principle

Do §4 (Auditability & Identity) first, then §2 (Branch / Repo Guardrails), then §3 (Actions & Supply Chain), then §1 (Issues & PRs).

The reason follows blast radius: close the highest-risk surfaces first.
§4 (identity) is the foundation — every later action must be attributable, so identity comes before anything else.
§2 (branch/merge guardrails) comes next, because an agent with an identity but no guardrails can still push directly to a protected branch or approve its own PR.
§3 (CI/supply-chain hardening) comes before the productivity surface because the CI surface is dangerous the moment any workflow runs on repo content — injection, privilege escalation, and supply-chain risks all activate at first workflow run.
§1 (templates, labels, CODEOWNERS, instruction files) is last because it is the least dangerous and depends on everything else being in place.

One dependency to observe: CODEOWNERS lives in §1, but the §2 required-review rule depends on it.
Create CODEOWNERS as part of the §2 step (or immediately before it), even though the rest of §1 comes last.

If the repository already runs Actions on untrusted input — a `pull_request_target` workflow, a workflow that accepts arbitrary `github.event.*` data in a `run:` step, or any workflow triggered by fork PRs with secrets — treat §3 as urgent; do not defer any of it.

## Procedure

### Step 1 — Establish agent identity (§4)

Provision a distinct, attributable identity for every agent that will work this repository.
Preference order: GitHub App (fine-grained permissions, short-lived tokens, clear audit trail) > fine-grained PAT (narrowly scoped, short expiry) > shared user account (avoid for automated work).
Never create or rely on classic broad PATs (closes T9).

For a GitHub App, create it at the org level and generate an installation token scoped to the target repository:

```sh
# Inspect an existing app installation (illustrative — substitute real app and org IDs)
gh api /orgs/{org}/installations \
  --jq '.installations[] | {app_slug, app_id, repository_selection}'

# Confirm token scopes for a specific installation.
# NOTE: the /app/* endpoints require authenticating AS THE APP with a JWT signed by the
# app's private key — a normal `gh auth login` user token will not work here.
# See the Agent Identity Setup artifact in examples.md.
gh api /app/installations/{installation_id}/access_tokens \
  --method POST \
  --field "repositories[]={repo_name}" \
  --jq '.permissions'
```

Set up commit signing before any agent commits land.
Decide the accepted mechanism — GitHub App commit signing (automatic when the App pushes via the API), GPG, or SSH — and record it in the repository so audits know what evidence to expect (closes T8).

See the **agent identity setup** artifact in [examples.md](examples.md) for App registration steps, a token-scope inventory table, and the co-authorship trailer format.

### Step 2 — Apply branch / repo guardrails (§2)

Create a repository ruleset targeting the default branch and any release branches.
The bypass-actors list must start empty — no admins, apps, or PATs may bypass the ruleset.
Merge queues operate through the normal ruleset flow and require no bypass entry (closes T4).

Required ruleset conditions:

- Required status checks; in monorepos, use a single always-running gate check that detects changed paths internally rather than `paths:`-filtering the workflow — a skipped required check stays PENDING and blocks merge forever.
- `dismiss_stale_reviews` enabled — a post-approval push invalidates the prior approval; this is a ruleset setting, not agent convention (closes T3).
  Note: this is the branch-protection field name; the equivalent ruleset API field is `dismiss_stale_reviews_on_push`.
- Signed commits required — matches the mechanism chosen in Step 1 (closes T8).
- Linear history required (closes T8).
- Force-push and branch deletion blocked on protected refs (closes T4).

Assemble auto-merge safety as a combination of three settings (GitHub has no single "human-only approver" flag):
required approving review count ≥ 1 + self-approval not counted + CODEOWNERS-required human review on protected paths (closes T3).

Add an environment protection rule for any production deployment target: require a named human reviewer or a timed wait before the environment job proceeds (closes T5).
If the default branch ruleset must require successful production deployment before merge, add a `required_deployments` rule for that environment.
See the **production environment gate** artifact in [examples.md](examples.md).

Apply the ruleset via `gh api` (illustrative — substitute your repo and the hardened ruleset JSON from [examples.md](examples.md)):

```sh
# Create a repository ruleset from a local JSON file
gh api /repos/{owner}/{repo}/rulesets \
  --method POST \
  --input hardened-ruleset.json

# List existing rulesets to confirm
gh api /repos/{owner}/{repo}/rulesets \
  --jq '.[].name'
```

See the **hardened ruleset JSON** artifact in [examples.md](examples.md) for the complete field set including `required_status_checks`, `dismiss_stale_reviews_on_push` (the ruleset field; the branch-protection equivalent is `dismiss_stale_reviews`), `required_signatures`, and `non_fast_forward`.

### Step 3 — Wire Actions / supply-chain hardening (§3)

Set least-privilege `GITHUB_TOKEN` permissions at the repository level (Settings → Actions → Workflow permissions → Read repository contents and packages) and enforce them in every workflow file with a top-level `permissions:` block that defaults to read-only; grant write scopes narrowly per job only (closes T5).
These are two distinct layers: the repository or organization default-token setting caps the maximum scope the token can ever be granted, while the per-workflow top-level `permissions:` block sets the actual scope for that specific workflow; configure both — the repository setting as a safety ceiling and the workflow block as the operative grant.

Pin every third-party action to a full commit SHA, not a mutable tag or `@main` (closes T6).
Enable OIDC for cloud authentication in place of stored long-lived secrets (closes T5, T9).

Ensure no untrusted `github.event.*` strings flow directly into `run:` steps — bind them through `env:` and reference the environment variable in shell (closes T2).
Audit `pull_request_target` usage: prefer replacing it with plain `pull_request`, which gets a read-only token and no repository secrets for fork workflows (closes T2).
If `pull_request_target` is unavoidable, no job checks out or executes untrusted head code, and any job with secrets or write scopes is gated behind a protected environment with a human reviewer.

Enable GitHub-native security features:

- Dependabot version and security updates (closes T6).
- Code scanning (CodeQL or equivalent) (closes T6).
- Secret scanning with push protection (closes T5).
- Dependency review action on pull requests, with a committed lockfile and (for private packages) a scoped registry so dependency confusion is blunted (closes T6, T7).

Do not enable `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` or `ACTIONS_RUNNER_DEBUG` in production environments — debug logging can expose secrets in logs (closes T5).

See the **least-privilege, injection-safe Actions workflow** artifact in [examples.md](examples.md) for a complete annotated example showing the top-level `permissions:` block, SHA-pinned actions, `env:`-bound event values, and OIDC credential exchange.

### Step 4 — Lay down the productivity surface (§1)

With guardrails in place, add the surfaces that make agents productive and contributions unambiguous (closes T1, T3).

**Issue and PR templates.**
Create `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` with templates for the issue types your project uses, and `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` covering the PR checklist (linked issue, test plan, security consideration).
See the **issue and PR templates** artifacts in [examples.md](examples.md).

**Label taxonomy.**
Define type labels (`type/bug`, `type/feature`, `type/chore`, `type/docs`) and priority labels (`priority/p0`–`priority/p2`).
In a monorepo, add `scope/<area>` labels for each major subtree so PRs and issues are routable without reading the diff.
See the **label taxonomy** artifact in [examples.md](examples.md).

**CODEOWNERS.**
Use explicit path prefixes — never a catch-all-only rule.
Owners on protected paths must be human users or teams, never bot or agent accounts, so a required review can never be satisfied by an agent (closes T3).
In a monorepo, one prefix per owned subtree.
See the **CODEOWNERS** artifact in [examples.md](examples.md).

**Draft-first convention.**
GitHub has no native "require draft by path" feature.
Document the convention in `AGENTS.md` and the operating playbook: protected-path changes open as drafts and wait for a human to promote them.
Do not make draft-state a required merge gate.
The enforceable control is the CODEOWNERS-required human review.
See the **draft-first convention** note in [examples.md](examples.md).

**`AGENTS.md` and per-tool files.**
Create a canonical `AGENTS.md` at the repo root covering branching strategy, commit format, review expectations, label use, test commands, and off-limits paths.
Per-tool files (`CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, etc.) are thin pointers — for Claude Code, the full content of `CLAUDE.md` is a single line: `@AGENTS.md`.
Reusable procedures belong as committed artifacts, not pasted into instruction files.
In a monorepo, add a nested `AGENTS.md` per subtree with meaningfully different rules.
See the **`AGENTS.md` pattern** artifact in [examples.md](examples.md).

**`.gitignore` and `.gitattributes`.**
Add a `.gitignore` covering secret-bearing and noise paths before running the first `git add`, so secrets are never staged; see the **Starter .gitignore** artifact in [examples.md](examples.md).
Add a `.gitattributes` (with `* text=auto eol=lf`) before cross-platform commits land, so line endings normalize from the start and generated files are collapsed in PR diffs; see the **Minimal .gitattributes** artifact in [examples.md](examples.md).

**`CONTRIBUTING` and `SECURITY.md`.**
Add `CONTRIBUTING.md` or `.github/CONTRIBUTING.md` describing branching, PR, and review expectations.
Add `SECURITY.md` — required for public repos and recommended for private repos — and cross-reference it with private vulnerability reporting (Step 5).

### Step 5 — Confirm public/private and monorepo specifics

Run through the variations that apply to your repository type:

**Monorepo.**
Confirm an always-running monorepo gate check is configured (not `paths:`-filtered) so a change in one subtree does not block unrelated subtrees (§2).
Confirm nested `AGENTS.md` files exist for subtrees with different rules (§1).
Confirm `scope/<area>` labels cover all major subtrees (§1).
Confirm CODEOWNERS has one prefix per owned subtree and is never catch-all-only (§1).
If a last-resort catch-all exists, confirm it is human-owned and appears after explicit path rules.

**Public repos.**
Enable private vulnerability reporting (GitHub Security → Private vulnerability reporting) and verify `SECURITY.md` references it (§4, §1).
Confirm secret scanning with push protection is active — GitHub enables it by default on public repos but verify it is not disabled.

**Private repos.**
Private repos get no guardrail exemption.
Apply identical rulesets, the same least-privilege `GITHUB_TOKEN` defaults, and the same CODEOWNERS rules.
Enable Dependabot and code scanning explicitly (not automatic for private repos on all plans).
Enable secret scanning with push protection where the plan provides it — it is free on public repos but requires GitHub Advanced Security on private repos; if GHAS is unavailable, record secret scanning as N/A in the audit rather than implying it can always be turned on.

## Verification

Before declaring setup done, re-walk [config-checklist.md](config-checklist.md) in full.
Every item must be recorded as one of:

- **Configured** — the specific GitHub field, setting, or file is named.
- **N/A** — one line stating why it does not apply to this repository.

This mirrors the Set up Done Criteria in SKILL.md: every checklist item configured or explicitly marked N/A, all emitted artifacts listed.

Checklist walkthrough by section:

**§1 Issues & PRs** — verify issue templates present, PR template present, label taxonomy defined (including `scope/<area>` if monorepo), CODEOWNERS with explicit prefixes and human-only owners on protected paths, required reviews enabled, draft-first convention documented, `AGENTS.md` present with thin per-tool adapter files, `CONTRIBUTING` present, `SECURITY.md` present.

**§2 Branch / Repo Guardrails** — verify ruleset targets default and release branches, bypass-actors list is empty, required status checks configured (always-running gate check if monorepo, not `paths:`-filtered), `dismiss_stale_reviews_on_push` set in ruleset, linear history required, signed commits required, merge queue configured if needed, force-push and deletion blocked, auto-merge safety assembled from the three-part combination, environment protection rules in place for production targets.

**§3 Actions & Supply Chain** — verify top-level `permissions:` block in every workflow defaults to read-only with write scopes granted narrowly per job only, no untrusted `github.event.*` values interpolated directly into `run:` steps, no `pull_request_target` workflow checks out or executes untrusted head code, any privileged `pull_request_target` job is environment-gated, all third-party actions pinned to full commit SHAs, OIDC used for cloud auth, `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` / `ACTIONS_RUNNER_DEBUG` not set in production, Dependabot enabled for actions and ecosystem dependencies, CodeQL or equivalent code scanning enabled, secret scanning with push protection enabled, dependency review action active on PRs.

**§4 Auditability & Identity** — verify distinct agent identity provisioned (GitHub App preferred), no classic broad PATs in use, fine-grained PATs short-lived if any, commits authored and signed with attribution preserved, audit-log retention considered at org level, no mid-session privilege escalation path exists (token scopes provisioned up front), private vulnerability reporting enabled on public repos.
